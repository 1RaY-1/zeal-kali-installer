# About
If you can't install [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/) by just typing ```apt install zeal``` in Kali Linux (or any other debian based linux distro), [this script](https://github.com/1RaY-1/zeal-installer/blob/main/install-zeal.sh) should help you.

It installs latest Zeal release for AMD64, x86_64 and I386 and it's dependencies (using curl, grep, wget and dpkg). 

If your PC is not AMD64, x86_64 or I386, you can find needed packages for your PC [here](http://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/z/zeal/
).

# Install
Type following command to install and run this script (to install zeal):
`
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1RaY-1/zeal-kali-installer/main/install-zeal.sh && sudo bash install-zeal.sh
`
