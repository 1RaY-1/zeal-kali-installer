# About
If you can't install [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/) via ```apt-get install zeal``` in Kali Linux, [this script](https://github.com/1RaY-1/zeal-installer/blob/main/install-zeal.sh) should help you.

[This script](https://github.com/1RaY-1/zeal-installer/blob/main/install-zeal.sh) installs latest [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/) version for AMD64, x86_64 and I386 and it's dependencies (using curl, grep, wget and dpkg). 

If your system architecture is not AMD64, x86_64 or I386, you can find needed packages for your system architecture [here](http://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/z/zeal/
).

*Don't forget to run this script with ```sudo``` command*
